# Complex-Numbers
A class of complex numbers

Create a class called Complex for performing arithmetic with complex numbers. Write a driver program to test your class.
Use double variables to represent the private data of the class. Provide a constructor function that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it is declared. 
The constructor should contain default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide public member functions for each of the following:
a)	Addition of two Complex numbers: The real parts are added together and the imaginary parts are added together.
b)	Subtraction of two Complex numbers: The real part of the right operand is subtracted from the real part of the left operand and the imaginary part of the right operand is subtracted from the imaginary part of the left operand.
c)	Printing Complex numbers in the form (a, b) where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

Complex numbers operators ( + , - , * , / )
